This is a text file documenting what I did today:
I guess I'll have to start by stating what day is today. Today is Monday, September 27, 2021. I have been working with SQL for the past week and we've been practicing using the JOIN function to JOIN
two tables within a database. 
One thing that I realized helps out is to forget about the selection until after joining all of the necessary tables.
