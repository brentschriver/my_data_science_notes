This is a text file documenting what I did today:
I guess I'll have to start by stating what day is today. Today is Monday, September 27, 2021. I have been working with SQL for the past week and we've been practicing using the JOIN function to JOIN
two tables within a database. 
One thing that I realized helps out is to forget about the selection until after joining all of the necessary tables.

Today, I installed a data vizualization tool. I've never worked with this tool before. It looks like a pretty powerful tool that allows you to visually move data around until you find the meaning you are looking for. I know it is going to take me a few hours of practice to get used to it. I still want to complete the spreadsheet exercises before I get started on my first project. I'll mess around with the new visualization tool after I send out an order, walk Meli along the river, and complete the spreadsheet exercises.

Took Meliods for another walk today. Poor Meli. I can always expect at least one dog to bark at Meli as we go on our walks.

Today we revisited Descriptive Statistics. Understanding descriptive statistics was one of the prerequisites to entering the bootcamp. I remember struggling through those Khan Academy courses for hours, daily. With perseverance through time, it all started to make sense. I even created a Python function to return all the statistical data. I'm excited to revisit this now during class to see what further insight I will gain.

Still on the road. Haven't been able to get good internet connection. I was able to catch some of today's lesson. I learned that decision trees are used to generate a prediction. At each node of a decision tree an evaluation is made based on a specified number of variables. The depth of the decision tree represents the number of questions asked about the data.
