This is a text file documenting what I did today:
I guess I'll have to start by stating what day is today. Today is Monday, September 27, 2021. I have been working with SQL for the past week and we've been practicing using the JOIN function to JOIN
two tables within a database. 
One thing that I realized helps out is to forget about the selection until after joining all of the necessary tables.

Today, I installed a data vizualization tool. I've never worked with this tool before. It looks like a pretty powerful tool that allows you to visually move data around until you find the meaning you are looking for. I know it is going to take me a few hours of practice to get used to it. I still want to complete the spreadsheet exercises before I get started on my first project. I'll mess around with the new visualization tool after I send out an order, walk Meli along the river, and complete the spreadsheet exercises.

Took Meliodas for a walk. Parked at The Pearl and walked all the way downtown where all the restaurants are. It's a good 15-20 minute walk. Meliodas loves to walk through the crowds of people. She walks so fast and gets annoyed when she gets stuck behind slow walkers. Well, I'm not sure if she feels annoyed, but I know I do. There are so many tourists downtown at the riverwalk. On the way back to The Pearl we stopped by Elsewhere to get some cold water. On the way out a retriever with silky brown fur barked at Meli. It startled her and she tried to run out of the place. I gave the dog a wierd look. I wonder if anybody saw the look I made.

Took Meliods for another walk today. Poor Meli. I can always expect at least one dog to bark at Meli as we go on our walks.

Today we revisited Descriptive Statistics. Understanding descriptive statistics was one of the prerequisites to entering the bootcamp. I remember struggling through those Khan Academy courses for hours, daily. With perseverance through time, it all started to make sense. I even created a Python function to return all the statistical data. I'm excited to revisit this now during class to see what further insight I will gain.
