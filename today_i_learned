This is a text file documenting what I did today:
I guess I'll have to start by stating what day is today. Today is Monday, September 27, 2021. I have been working with SQL for the past week and we've been practicing using the JOIN function to JOIN
two tables within a database. 
One thing that I realized helps out is to forget about the selection until after joining all of the necessary tables.

Today, I installed a data vizualization tool. I've never worked with this tool before. It looks like a pretty powerful tool that allows you to visually move data around until you find the meaning you are looking for. I know it is going to take me a few hours of practice to get used to it. I still want to complete the spreadsheet exercises before I get started on my first project. I'll mess around with the new visualization tool after I send out an order, walk Meli along the river, and complete the spreadsheet exercises.
